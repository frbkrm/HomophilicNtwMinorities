# HomophilicNtwMinorities

The code generates networks with two groups that can vary in size. 

The network is generated using combination of preferential attachment and homophily. The homophily is a parameter that indicates the attractiveness between two nodes i and j, denoted as $h_{ij}$.

The homophily parameter is ranging between 0 to 1.
